The challenge is meant to come up with a JKUAT AGGES website that will serve the club by bringing together the alumni, connecting students to potential companies and even current geospatial  technologies.This will even alleviate the hustles the junior students need to go through to realise even the basic geospatial concepts.

## Important Dates

* This challenge was officially launched on 7th October 2021 at JKUAT-AGGES Weekly meetup room, Hall 7 room 005.
* Evaluation dates and closure of the competition was 7th February 2022.
* The launch of the Version 1.0.0 of the AGGES website was Thursday 10th March 2022

Our assessment covers the following areas:

-   A correct fork, branch and pull request from the main branch.
-   We will use github timestamp
-	Architecture 
        - How have you decided to structure your app? 
        - Is there good separation of concerns or things/pages are cluttered?
-	Code quality 
       - Are you following good coding practices? 
       - Is your code easy to follow and maintain? 
       - Is it testable? 
       - Is it transferable?
-	Correctness 
	   - Does your application work? 
	   - Does it meet the functional spec?
-	Technical choices 
       - Are your choices of libraries, packages, and tooling appropriate?

Bonus points:

-	Testing - Is there adequate test coverage?
-	UX - Is your project easy to use and understand?
-	UI -Is the User interface attractive to the viewer?

## Task
With the asssumption that you are using frontend framework of your choice create a new JKUAT AGGES Club website that will serve the club. 
- Kindly check out the following guidelines:

- Perfomance and speed is essential
- The Website should be fully responsive

### Technical specs

Choose one of the following technical tracks to build the functionality described in the Functional spec that best suits your skill set:

-	Back-end track: build a REST API and include a minimal front-end (e.g. a browsable API)
-	Front-end track: build your project as a purely client-side app
-	Full Stack: blend the former approaches, but be sure to demonstrate your competence across the stack

#### Front-end
- We prefer adoption of [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/), [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/) and [Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) for this stack. However you can use any tool to make your web design upto the desired appeal. <br>
- Your project can be built using any JavaScript or CSS framework, though we encourage [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/), Redux and CSS/SCSS. You are also welcome to use our [React-ions library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-ions) to help build your UI.

Alternatively, feel free to swap out similar JavaScript frameworks such as Angular and UI kits such as Bootstrap. In addition to building the application.

#### Back-end
- You can use any database of your choice to enable storage of the various archives.
- Your task is to build a REST API that can support the functionality of the site. Your project can be built using any API framework/language, though we encourage the use of [Django Rest Framework](http://www.django-rest-framework.org/)/Python. Your API should be able to:

-   Perform CRUD actions for the gallery page, blog page, archive page, events page and about page.
-   Perform analytics from the page e.g number of visits per day, user location

You do not have to build a functional UI unless you want to show off your talents across the stack. We will test your API by using the Browsable API. You are encouraged to write tests to verify your own results.

#### README

In your repo, please include the following items in your README:

-	Whether the solution focuses on back-end, front-end or full stack.
-	Reasoning behind your technical choices, including architecture.
-	Trade-offs you might have made, anything you left out, or what you might do differently if you were to spend additional time on the project.
-	Link to the hosted application (where applicable).

This will give us insight into how you approached the challenge.

### Tips
- Comment your code to show your thought process
- Submit this web design as a directory in your pull request named "{yourname_Task}"
- Make sure your have deployed your site to [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), [heroku](https://www.heroku.com) or [github pages](https://pages.github.com/)
