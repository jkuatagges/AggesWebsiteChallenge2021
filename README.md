### Technical specs

Choose one of the following technical tracks to build the functionality described in the Functional spec that best suits your skill set:

-	Back-end track: build a REST API and include a minimal front-end (e.g. a browsable API)
-	Front-end track: build your project as a purely client-side app
-	Full Stack: blend the former approaches, but be sure to demonstrate your competence across the stack

#### Front-end

Your project can be built using any JavaScript or CSS framework, though we encourage [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/), Redux and CSS/SCSS. You are also welcome to use our [React-ions library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-ions) to help build your UI.

Alternatively, feel free to swap out similar JavaScript frameworks such as Angular and UI kits such as Bootstrap. In addition to building the application.

#### Back-end

Your task is to build a REST API that can support the functionality of the site. Your project can be built using any API framework/language, though we encourage the use of [Django Rest Framework](http://www.django-rest-framework.org/)/Python. Your API should be able to:

-   Perform CRUD actions for the gallery page, blog page, archive page, events page and about page.
-   Perform analytics from the page e.g number of visits per day, user location

You do not have to build a functional UI unless you want to show off your talents across the stack. We will test your API by using the Browsable API. You are encouraged to write tests to verify your own results.

#### README

In your repo, please include the following items in your README:

-	Whether the solution focuses on back-end, front-end or full stack.
-	Reasoning behind your technical choices, including architecture.
-	Trade-offs you might have made, anything you left out, or what you might do differently if you were to spend additional time on the project.
-	Link to the hosted application (where applicable).

This will give us insight into how you approached the challenge.

### Tips
- Comment your code to show your thought process
- Submit this web design as a directory in your pull request named "{yourname_Task}"
